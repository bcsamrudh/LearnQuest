LearnQuest is a website that helps students share study notes and generate questions based on the notes using AI. It allows students to upload their notes, which are then used by AI to generate questions. Students can also view and comment on each other's notes, which helps them to learn from each other and improve their understanding of the material.

LearnQuest provides the following features:

- **Note Sharing**: Users can upload and share their notes with the community.
- **Comments**: Users can comment on notes to provide feedback or ask questions.
- **Upvoting**: Users can upvote their favorite notes to show appreciation.
- **Note Download**: Users can download notes for offline access.
- **Question Generation**: Users can generate questions based on the content of the notes.
- **Accessible UI**: The website is made accessible so that everybody can take advantage of the website.
